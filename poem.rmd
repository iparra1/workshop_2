Silent, with hands crost meekly on his breast,  
Long time, with keen and meditative eye,   
Stood the old painter of Siena by        
A canvas, whose sign manual him confest.     

His head droopt low, his eye ceased from its quest,  
As tears filled full the fountains long since dry;  
And from his lips there broke the haunting cry:  
'May God forgive me - I did not my best!'
